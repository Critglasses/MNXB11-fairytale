Previous summoning attempts and their fate: A scholar haunted by gift of 
curiousity had brewed forbidden herbs and traced seals in the dark,
coaxing a response from the unseen. At night, a spectral whisper came,
answering one question at a time, each reply exacting a memory in return. 
By dawn, the scholar could recall solutions to riddles no mortal mind should 
hold—but with every answer, pieces of himself slipped away. Eventually, 
he solved the problem that had obsessed him, yet when he looked into a mirror, 
the face staring back was a stranger’s. Curiousity had been won, but the price 
had claimed the man himself.
