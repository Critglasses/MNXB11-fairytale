Mythological background on Death:
The entity known as Azizoth, or Death, is an ancient spirit thought to have been created along with the mortal plane long ago. Many societies across the ages have had some form of belief in Azizoth, along with their own name and customs surrounding it. Furthermore, every culture has had a unique way of trying to contact the spirit and gain its favor. Most cultures have failed in this aspect, only managing to annoy or inconvenience it, resulting in cataclysmic retaliation. The ritual in this manual has been extensively researched and tested; showing great promise in gaining a boon from Death itself.

Eventually, he solved the problem that had obsessed him, yet when he looked into a mirror, the face staring back was a stranger’s. Curiousity had been won, but the price had claimed the man himself.
